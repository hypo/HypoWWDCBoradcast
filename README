== 程式作用 WHAT IT DOES ==

   本程式為 hypo 進行 WWDC 轉播時所使用的程式。希望如果各位有類似的即時轉播需求的時候，可以省下大量的程式開發時間，
   將時間花在調整介面適合您的活動以及讓您有更多的時間籌劃更好的活動。

   This application was used by Hypo to cover WWDC ‘09 live.  We’ve made a promise and are releasing it now.
   With our application, you may concentrate on delivering a live coverage front-end instead of having to spare
   time coding a supporting back-end.


== 使用方式 HOW IT WORKS ==

   wwdc 資料夾是完整的線上轉播以及聊天室的程式。要使用這個程式進行轉播您首先需要申請一個 AppEngine 帳號並且申請一個應用程式。
   請先將您的應用程式名稱填入 app.yaml 的 application: 一欄，替換掉原本的 hypowwdc。
   接著使用 Google AppEngine SDK 提供的工具上傳到您的應用程式中就可以使用了。
   
   如果您要發佈訊息，請先將所有需要發佈訊息的使用者的 Google Accounts 全部
   加入您 AppEngine 主控台的合作者名單中。
   接著瀏覽 http://您的程式網址/admin ，使用您的 Google 帳號登入就可以看到後台。

   You’ll find the entire application in the WWDC folder.  Simply apply an Google App Engine account, and have your app 
   registered.  Then you’re ready to go.

   However, you’ll locate app.yaml, and fill your own application name under the field “application:” replacing our
   default “hypowwdc”.  After this, use Google’s utility (provided in App Engine SDK) to upload the entire folder.

   Now your application is up and running.

   You still have to authorize your collaborators from your App Engine dashboard before they could post updates.
   Finally, go http://[yourapps].[domain]/admin and sign in with your Google account.
